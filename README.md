# Overview
JFrog CLI is a compact and smart client that provides a simple interface that automates access to *Artifactory*, *Bintray* and *Mission Control* through their respective REST APIs.
By using the JFrog CLI, you can greatly simplify your automation scripts making them more readable and easier to maintain.
Several features of the JFrog CLI makes your scripts more efficient and reliable:

- Multi-threaded upload and download of artifacts make builds run faster
- Checksum optimization reduces redundant file transfers
- Wildcards and regular expressions give you an easy way to collect all the artifacts you wish to upload or download.
- "Dry run" gives you a preview of file transfer operations before you actually run them

# Download and Installation

You can get the executable directly from the [JFrog CLI Download Page](https://www.jfrog.com/getcli/), or you can download the source files from this GitHub project and build it yourself.

On Mac you can run:
````
brew install jfrog-cli-go
````

# Building the Executable

JFrog CLI is written in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/), so to build the CLI yourself, you first need to have Go installed and configured on your machine.

## Setup Go

To download and install `Go`, please refer to the [Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).
Please download `Go 1.9` or above.

Navigate to the directory where you want to create the jfrog-cli-go project, and set the value of the GOPATH environment variable to the full path of this directory.

## Download and Build the CLI

To download the jfrog-cli-go project, execute the following command:
````
go get github.com/AngelloMaggio/jfrog-cli-go/jfrog-cli/jfrog
````
Go will download and build the project on your machine. Once complete, you will find the JFrog CLI executable under your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

# Tests

### Artifactory tests
#### General tests
To run Artifactory tests execute the following command: 
````
go test -v github.com/AngelloMaggio/jfrog-cli-go/jfrog-cli/jfrog
````
Optional flags:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-rt.url` | [Default: http://localhost:8081/artifactory] Artifactory URL. |
| `-rt.user` | [Default: admin] Artifactory username. |
| `-rt.password` | [Default: password] Artifactory password. |
| `-rt.apikey` | [Optional] Artifactory API key. |
| `-rt.sshKeyPath` | [Optional] Ssh key file path. Should be used only if the Artifactory URL format is ssh://[domain]:port |
| `-rt.sshPassphrase` | [Optional] Ssh key passphrase. |


* Running the tests will create two repositories: `jfrog-cli-tests-repo` and `jfrog-cli-tests-repo1`.<br/>
  Once the tests are completed, the content of these repositories will be deleted.
  
#### Build tools tests
* The *M2_HOME* environment variable should be set to the local maven installation path.
* The *gradle* executable path should be included as part of the *PATH* environment variable.
* The *java* executable be included as part of the *PATH* environment variable. Alternatively, set the *JAVA_HOME* environment variable.

To run build tools tests execute the following command:
````
go test -v github.com/AngelloMaggio/jfrog-cli-go/jfrog-cli/jfrog -test.artifactory=false -test.buildTools=true
````
##### Limitation
* Currently, build integration support only http(s) connections to Artifactory using username and password.

#### Docker push test

To run docker push tests execute the following command (fill out the missing parameters as described below):
````
go test -v github.com/AngelloMaggio/jfrog-cli-go/jfrog-cli/jfrog -test.artifactory=false -test.docker=true -rt.dockerRepoDomain=DOCKER_DOMAIN -rt.dockerTargetRepo=DOCKER_TARGET_REPO -rt.url=ARTIFACTORY_URL -rt.user=USERNAME -rt.password=PASSWORD
````
##### Mandatory Parameters
| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-rt.dockerRepoDomain` | Artifactory Docker registry domain. |
| `-rt.dockerTargetRepo` | Artifactory Docker repository name. |
| `-rt.url` | Artifactory URL. |
| `-rt.user` | Artifactory username. |
| `-rt.password` | Artifactory password. |

##### Important
* Before running the test make sure docker is logged in to the Artifactory docker registry (run `docker login` before the test).

### Bintray tests
Bintray tests credentials are taken from the CLI configuration. If non configured or not passed as flags, the tests will fail.

To run Bintray tests execute the following command: 
````
go test -v github.com/AngelloMaggio/jfrog-cli-go/jfrog-cli/jfrog -test.artifactory=false -test.bintray=true
````
Flags:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-bt.user` | [Mandatory if not configured] Bintray username. |
| `-bt.key` | [Mandatory if not configured] Bintray API key. |
| `-bt.org` | [Optional] Bintray organization. If not configured, *-bt.user* is used as the organization name. |

* Running the tests will create a repository `jfrog-cli-tests-repo1` in bintray.<br/>
  Once the tests are completed, the repository will be deleted.
